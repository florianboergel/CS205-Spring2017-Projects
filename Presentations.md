#### Presentation: 10 mins,  Qs:   3mins, Switch over:  2 mins 

## Evaluation criteria
Prepare your powerpoint for a 10min presentation. You will be assessed on how effectively you communicate 
- the 'big picture' to a non-specialist
- the 'depth of the work' undertaken to a specialist focussing on the science  and the computer science.

## Peer evaluation
Note that you have to be present for your session to perform peer evaluation of presentations. You can attend both sessions.
